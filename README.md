# Sonar-actuated-SMA-with-Sound-Effects
Ultrasonic Distance Sensor actuated SMA Springs with piezo sound effect

Working code is Placeholder_1_9, others are earlier, non-functioning (or partically functioning) iterations. 

This program is for Arduino with 1 ultrasonic distance sensor (4-pin), 2 SMA springs, and 2 piezo buzzers. If something goes within range of the sensor, a state machine is activated to heat and cool the springs with while white noise is emitted.
